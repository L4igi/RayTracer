# Basic RayTracer using C++
This basic ray tracer was implemented as part of the Graphics (Media Informatics) at the University of Vienna. The Program is able to read stats for Camera, Light, 
Surface/Geometry Materials and Transformations from an XML File. 

To read in PNG files, PNG Loader, for OBJ files tiny object loader was used. The rest of the implementation was created from scratch. The purpose of this project was 
to gain a deeper understanding of gtaphic processing in general and how light behaves with different shapes and materials.
